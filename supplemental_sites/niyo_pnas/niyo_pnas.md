Arm movements are disrupted by unmodulated stretch reflexes. We quantified disruptions to arm movements caused by unmodulated stretch reflexes, and propose a spinal cord circuit that could be as good as, and complement, mechanisms mediated by the brain and cerebellum. This has implications to the emergence and treatment of movement disorders.

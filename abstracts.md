<b><a href="../Abstracts/2024_SfN_Vestibular_output_is_gated.pdf" title="Background: The vestibular system is among the oldest and most fundamental contributors to motor behavior as it is critical to maintaining posture and balance. However, such low-level signals could interfere with cortically-mediated voluntary behavior that naturally affects posture and balance. Consequently, it has been proposed that vestibular output is ‘gated’ (dubbed vestibular suppression) to avoid undesirable self-perturbations during voluntary head movements and locomotion. Here we demonstrate such gating also occurs for voluntary arm function. We tested sixteen unimpaired young adults (mean age: 19.2, range: 18-27 years old) under three seated tasks: rest, isometric contraction, and voluntary reaching movement with their right arm. EMG signals were recorded from upper extremity and neck muscles: Biceps (Bic) and Triceps Brachii(Tri), Anterior (ADelt), Middle (MDelt) and Posterior (PDelt) Heads of Deltoid, Upper Trapezius (UTrap), and Sternocleidomastoid (SCM). The strength of our evidence comes from comparing coherence at baseline (No Stimulation) and after either Sham or Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS). Our results show clear patterns of reduced pair-wise Intermuscular Coherence between specific neck muscles during visual tracking at rest and during voluntary arm isometric contractions and reaching movements. Specifically, the coherence between neck muscles (SCM- UTrap) seen at rest increased when GVS was applied, but it was suppressed when their gaze was fixed on a screen. Moreover, this increased coherence in neck muscles was also suppressed during voluntary isometric contractions and reaching movements even when GVS was applied. Thus, these findings extend vestibular suppression to voluntary arm function. On the other hand, no changes were found in pairwise intermuscular coherence during Sham (compared with No stimulation) or in arm muscles at either rest or during voluntary movement during GVS in neurotypical adults. Consequently, this confirms the common (yet unproven to our knowledge) notion that arm muscles do not receive vestibular neural drive. In addition to shedding light on the mechanisms that mediate competing descending outputs for voluntary function, this work also serves as a baseline against which to compare potential task-dependent dysregulation of vestibular-mediated output to the neck and arms in stroke and neurological conditions..">

<b><a href="../Abstracts/2024_NCM_Angelo_Bartsch.pdf" title="Background: Intermuscular coherence (IMC) quantifies the degree of synchronization between two electromyography (EMG) signals to reveal their shared neural drive. As such, it is gaining popularity as a means to pinpoint the origin of neural drive causing upper extremity pathological synergies in stroke—as multiple pathways could be responsible. Purpose: While the imbalance of cortico- and reticulo-spinal tracts is thought to contribute to pathological synergies, this study aims to exclude the vestibulo-spinal tract as a potential contributor to arm muscle neural drive—as measured by IMC. Methods: As a first step, we recorded IMC during three conditions: No stimulation, Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS), and Sham. We tested 16 unimpaired young adults (mean age: 19.2, range: 18-27 years old) under three tasks: rest, isometric contraction, and voluntary reaching movement with their right arm. EMG signals were recorded from upper extremity muscles: Biceps (Bic) and Triceps Brachii (Tri), Anterior (ADelt), Middle (MDelt) and Posterior (PDelt) Heads of Deltoid, and Upper Trapezius (UTrap); and one neck muscle: Sternocleidomastoid (SCM), as a control for GVS. Magnitude-squared coherence from EMG was estimated across muscle pairs in the 8- 50Hz frequency range. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) determined the specific frequencies at which there were differences across tasks and muscle pairs. Robust Statistical Methods were used to test for IMC changes after GVS and Sham under each Task (Rest, Isometric, and Reaching) for all muscle pairs. Results and Conclusion: As expected, GVS increased IMC in the SCM-UTrap muscle pair from 11 to 50Hz (spanning alpha-, beta-, and gamma-frequency bands), during the resting condition. In contrast, upper extremity IMC during isometric contraction and reaching movements did not increase under GVS— excluding the vestibulo-spinal tract as a contributor to neural drive to arm muscles during voluntary movement. This allows us to more confidently interpret the source of movement disorders in stroke survivors.">

<b><a href="../Papers/2023_niyo_pre-sfn_motor_symposium.pdf" title="The primary motor cortex does not uniquely or directly produce the alpha drive (α-drive) activations to arm muscles during voluntary movement. Rather, α-drive activations emerge from the synthesis of signals from multiple descending tracts, fusimotor gains, sensory inputs, and spinal interneurons. This includes the inhibition of velocity-dependent stretch reflexes provided by the primary (Ia) muscle spindle sensory signals in eccentrically contracting muscles, which otherwise would disrupt voluntary movement [1,2]. I.e., “Inhibition is as important as excitation.” Spinal circuits for such homonymous (from the same muscle) and reciprocal (from other muscles) inhibition of stretch reflexes have been proposed mostly for the special (and experimentally tractable) case of single joints with clear agonist and antagonist muscles [3,4], but require careful real-time balance of fusimotor (gamma static (γ-static) and gamma dynamic (γ-dynamic) motoneurons) gains [5,6] in ways that are not entirely understood and are likely difficult to conclusively establish experimentally. Importantly, these circuits for the mono-articular case [3,4] are not guaranteed to generalize to the natural condition of numerous muscles crossing multiple joints during the production of large and fast 3-dimensional limb movements in the presence of gravity.">

<b><a href="../Papers/2023_Erwin_DARE_Coherence_Intermuscular coherence.pdf" title="Synchronous activity between electromyography (EMG) signals at high frequencies (>7 Hz), i.e., intermuscular coherence, is thought to reveal shared neural input to muscles from multiple descending pathways. As such it may be able to quantify the extent and nature of neuroplasticity across descending pathways during neurorehabilitation, as well as changes in ‘synergies of neural origin’. As an essential step towards clinical utility of intermuscular coherence in neurorehabilitation, we extended Laine et al. (J Physiol, 2021) and contrasted alpha-band neural drive strength between eight young (29 +/- 4.3 years) and eight older adults (59 +/- 7.6 years—within the age range in the population of stroke survivors). Using their right arm, participants rotated an ergometer (a practical analogue to reaching tasks that can be done in the home) while surface EMG was measured from seven muscles including the upper trapezius, triceps (lateral head), biceps (short and long heads), and deltoid (anterior, middle, posterior). EMG data were high-pass filtered using a fourth-order Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 250 Hz and then the signals were rectified. Magnitude squared coherence was estimated across all muscle pairs (21 comparisons), and across the rotation cycle in 10 degree increments (36 bins). While young participants exhibited larger alpha-band intermuscular coherence compared to older adults, differences were generally small as the difference in grand mean for 16/21 comparisons had an alpha-band intermuscular coherence < 0.04. Large differences occurred in comparisons between synchronization involving adelt with mdelt, pdelt, and utrap (alpha-band coherence > 0.06) This preliminary study of the previously unexplored age-dependent nature of coherence during cyclical reaching movements suggests that aging does not significantly affect mean coherence across all muscles and phases of the cycle. If this result is further validated, it would provide a rigorous biomarker baseline against which to compare motor impairment in adults after neurological injuries, such as stroke. In particular, our paradigm for directly investigating neuroplasticity is well-suited for translation to deployment in the home.">

<b><a href="../Abstracts/2022_SFN_Almofeez_Voluntary_movement_in_the_presence_of_muscle_afferentation.pdf" title="Multiple computational models of neuromuscular control include cortico-spinal drive as the primary (or only) command signal to a muscle. However, actual α-motoneuron activation results from summation of excitatory and inhibitory descending, propriospinal, sensory and proprioceptive synaptic inputs. Muscle spindles provide homologous and heteronomous proprioceptive inputs encoding muscle fiber length and velocity, while γ-motoneurons can modulate these spindle outputs, the extent to which the spindle feedback inputs alters limb kinematics is unknown. Here we model the functional effects of excitatory spindle afferent signals on limb kinematics to quantify whether and how the open loop descending cortico-spinal drive to α-motoneurons needs to be adjusted to counterbalance spindle afferent signals. Similar to (Hagen and Valero-Cuevas 2017), we used a 31-muscle Macaque arm model in MuJoCo and generated 100 open loop α-motoneuron commands that produced random free arm movements lasting 2 seconds starting from rest. We then systematically added excitatory monosynaptic spindle afferent to each muscle. We compared the baseline motion to the resulting disrupted trajectories and endpoint location after using five incremental feedback gains, proportional to the lengthening and eccentric velocity of each muscle. As expected, movements inducing greater fiber lengthening and eccentric velocities tended to be more disrupted as gain increased. But these trajectory and endpoint disruption were neither linear nor necessarily kinematically significant. Our findings highlight that each arm movement must have a distinct, nonlinear compensatory interaction between α and γ motoneuron drives, which can range from subtle to strong. Moreover, our conceptual approach to computational neuromuscular control and learning should be broadened to encompass dynamic muscle afferentation.">

Usually, muscle synergies are defined using these dimensionality reduction techniques from the basis functions that account for 90% of variance in the original signal. However, the residual activity (remaining 10%) is not entirely random and can inform the execution of motor tasks. To test the importance of residual activity to capture the fine features of upper-arm cyclical motion, we compared the task progress prediction error based on (i) EMG activity and (ii) after its dimensionality reduction.">

<b><a href="../Abstracts/2022_SFN_Chakravarthi Raja_Abstract.pdf" title="It is still unknown in detail to what extent and in what way spinally-mediated sensorimotor mechanisms contribute to natural voluntary movement. Specifically, there is a need to disambiguate the functional contribution of descending alpha (α) and gamma (γdynamic, γstatic) cortico-spinal projections from propriospinal, sensory, and proprioceptive projections. As an extension of our neuromorphic computational  approach in Jalaledini et al. (2017), Niu et al. (2017) and Nagamori et al. (2021), we actuated a tendon-driven single-joint robotic finger using motors programmed to act in real-time as an agonist-antagonist pair of Hill-Type muscles. In addition to modeling spiking neurons (Izhikevich, 2003), muscle spindles (Mileusnic et al., 2006) and Golgi tendon organs (Mileusnic and Loeb, 2006), their stretch reflex pathways were also innervated by descending α, γdynamic, and γstatic drives. The α drive (in pulses per second, pps) was set to produce slow sinusoidal or point-to-point movements on the robotic finger's joint. By sweeping across  various values of amplitude and relative phase of the γdynamic and γstatic drives to the two muscles, we were able to quantify the effect of these various α-γ interactions on joint kinematics. 'Realism of movement' was quantified using three metrics: 1. magnitude of voluntary movement, measured in degrees; 2. deviation from minimum jerk to measure smoothness; and 3. two-thirds power law to compare movements with varying parameters. We saw that only a particular, typically phase-advanced family of γ drive profiles enables greater sinusoidal joint movements. Also, careful scheduling of γ drives during the ramp and hold phases is crucial to accurately start and stop point-to-point movement. Our results highlight that only certain families of task-specific amplitudes and phases of γ drives are sufficient (yet not necessary) to produceic motor action. This warrants further study in human neuromorphic models to validate the nuanced role of descending α-γ cortico-spinal commands in enabling spinal circuits to produce natural voluntary movement.">

The quadruped creates an implicit model of its own kinematics by undergoing five minutes of motor babbling and training an artificial neural network (ANN) to produce the inverse kinematics through usage of the General-to-Particular (G2P) autonomous learning algorithm (Marjaninejad, Urbina-Mel´endez, et al., 2019a; Sun et al., 2019). By feeding a set of desired kinematics into this ANN we produce a set of motor activations that the model predicts will result in those kinematics; the error between desired and actual kinematics obtained from the activations can then be used to refine the model with a few-shot learning approach.">

<b><a href="../Abstracts/cohn_sfn_2018.pdf" title="Vertebrate systems operate limbs with many more muscles than degrees of freedom, which creates redundancies for isometric force production. Optimization is usually proposed as the means by which the nervous system solves such underdetermined problem. However, the learning and execution problem can also be approached from the geometric perspective of heuristic or systematic exploration of high-dimensional spaces, and exploitation of feasible regions found and remembered. We apply such approach to assess the learnability of the input-tension to output fingertip force mapping for the seven tendons of a human cadaver index finger. We applied five thousand different 7-dimensional tension vectors, while simultaneously recording the resulting isometric fingertip force outputs. We analyzed the relationship between the input and output in both the forward and inverse directions using. a linear regression model, an Artificial Neural Network, and a data-driven Nearest-Neighbor lookup table. We find that forward models perform more accurately than inverse models and that the Nearest-Neighbor approach has a notable fit error at the edges of the input space. These results open a new front for a thorough understanding of how the actual physics of an anatomical system (i.e., the plant the brain must contend with) fundamentally affects learning, memory, and performance of motor function in health, disease, and in an evolutionary context. Figure 1: A parallel coordinate plot of 5000 muscle tension patterns implemented on a human cadaver finger highlights how sparsely the edges of the input space are explored with uniform sampling.">

<b><a href="../Abstracts/hagen_sfn_2018.pdf" title="Deciding how to move the hand along a given path to produce activities for daily living (ADLs) involves multiple factors such as limb kinetics, choice of muscle activation patterns, online error corrections, robustness to perturbations, accounting for length/velocity muscle mechanics and time-sensitive reflex modulation. In Hagen & Valero-Cuevas (2017) we show how the joint rotations associated with different paths induce different musculotendon (MT) velocities. While different paths will naturally produce different MT velocities, we found that similar paths can exhibit different MT velocity profiles. This matters at the level of individual muscles because differences in MT velocities will require unique muscle activation strategies to compensate for force-length/force-velocity properties and modulation of their spinal reflex mechanisms. Importantly, these differences in MT velocities within and across paths establish the neuromechanical landscape that determines the robustness of muscle coordination patterns and reflex modulation strategies during ADLs.Here we study how initial variability in the direction of a hand path affects the subsequent time histories of MT velocities. As in our prior work, we used an 18 muscle, 2 joint planar arm model to produce 100 random reaching paths for 6 different pairs of points on a tabletop (3 pairs shared the starting position, 3 pairs shared the ending location). Each valid, smooth reaching path was generated (and its MT velocities found) using a pseudo-random clamped cubic spline, parameterized to follow a bell-shaped tangential velocity curve, simulating reaching movements of 35 cm in length with initial errors compatible with those seen in reaching studies in humans.We find that uniform initial error (i.e., variability) across paths induces non-uniform distributions of MT velocities. That is, although the induced MT velocities follow a similar profile for each reaching movement, their distributions/deviations change across them. This implies that some reaching paths may be more or less forgiving to initial errors in muscle coordination or reflex modulation. This has important consequences to the study of healthy movement, as well as the rehabilitation of movement for ADLs in neurological conditions and stroke.">

<b><a href="../Abstracts/Akira_Nagamori_SfN_2018_Abstract.pdf" title="Involuntary force variability is an inherent property of motor behavior. When exacerbated, it is a key contributor to performance errors and a feature of several neurological conditions. Some propose that involuntary force variability arises primarily through the conversion of motoneuron firing patterns into muscle force, i.e. “motor noise.” This mechanism has been tested using a model of recruitment and rate coding developed by Fuglevand et al. (1993). However, this model has several drawbacks that limit its ability to simulate force variability. First, it does not explicitly model the fusion of force twitches with increases in firing rate and concomitant saturation of calcium binding to troponin. Second, the model lacks a series elastic element (i.e., tendon), which damps out the effects of fluctuations of motoneurone firing by changing its length and, thereby, the velocity of the muscle fibers in an externally isometric system. We addressed these limitations by combining some elements of the Fuglevand model with physiological and mechanical features from a model by Song et al. (2008). This new model has improved predictions of force and force variability. Upon close inspection, we show the amplitude and spectral features of force variability are significantly influenced by the viscoelastic properties of musculotendons. This model of motor units produces a lower amplitude of force variability than previous models. Also, spectral features of this new model resemble more closely what has been observed experimentally. These results question current thinking attributing the majority of involuntary force variability to peripheral motor noise, and highlight the importance of closed-loop behavior including afferent feedback and error corrections.">

(2017) we implemented a realtime Field-Programmable Gate Array  (FPGA)-based simulation of neuromorphic models of monosynaptic stretch reflex circuitry of an agonist-antagonist muscle-pair. We then characterized the system in Jalaleddini, et al. (2017) by coupling the simulation to the flexor digitorum profundus and the extensor carpi radialis longus tendons of the MCP joint of a cadaveric hand preparation to show that such systems can indeed evoke human-like stretch reflexes as in the work of Edin and Vallbo (1990). We now present improvements to that system such as including Golgi tendon organs, Renshaw cells, and polysynaptic interneuronal pathways to form a system akin to a simplified spinal-like regulator as in Raphael et al. (2010). Nonlinear adaptive controls and simple neural networks allow us tune the descending commands (pulse trains) to both fusimotor and alpha motoneuron pools. We use such time-based running of descending commands to demonstrate the ability to produce “voluntary” movement. We find that realistic models of muscle mechanics, force-velocity properties in particular, are critical to produce stable movements. By selectively adding/removing components and interconnections, we are also able to show the sufficiency of the same for enabling voluntary movement. Future extensions will include homonymous and heteronymous sensorimotor pathways to control more muscles and produce motor function in cadaveric human fingers.">

<b><a href="../Abstracts/AN_NCM_Abstract_2018.pdf" title="Accurate and precise movement executions are confronted with variability associated with generation of muscle force. Such variability arises from various sources including mechanical properties of muscles and limbs, motor unit properties, proprioceptive feedback, and descending neural commands. Previously, contributions of individual sources have been studied in isolation and in a feedforward manner. However, those factors interact during closed-loop control, which describes nearly all experimental paradigms in which muscle force must be voluntarily controlled. Recently, we showed using a closed-loop simulation of an afferented muscle that neuromechanical interactions among neural noise, mechanical properties of musculotendon unit, proprioceptive feedback and error corrective mechanism suffice to explain cardinal features of involuntary force variability previously observed experimentally. Here, we attempt to extend this observation by incorporating new elements in our model. New elements added to our existing model include stochastic motor unit firing patterns, conversion of neural firing into muscle force, and additional spinal feedback pathways within and across muscles (pathway involved with monosynaptic Ia excitatory feedback, Ia inhibitory interneurons, Ib interneurons, Renshaw inhibitory interneurons, propriospinal interneurons,). Our results show that motor unit properties are important, yet are typically insufficient to explain the majority of force variability or its frequency spectrum. Importantly, we demonstrate previously an unrecognized influence of coordinated activities between two muscles on the amplitude and spectral features of force variability. These results highlight potential importance of such neuromechanical interactions in understanding the generation of force variability in precise and accurate motor tasks and explaining physiological mechanisms of altered neuromuscular control in health and diseases.">

      <tr title="Vertebrate systems operate limbs with many more muscles than degrees of freedom, which creates redundancies for isometric force production. Optimization is usually proposed as the means by which the nervous system solves such underdetermined problem. However, the learning and execution problem can also be approached from the geometric perspective of heuristic or systematic exploration of high-dimensional spaces, and exploitation of feasible regions found and remembered. We apply such approach to assess the learnability of the input-tension to output fingertip force mapping for the seven tendons of a human cadaver index finger. We applied five thousand different 7-dimensional tension vectors, while simultaneously recording the resulting isometric fingertip force outputs. We analyzed the relationship between the input and output in both the forward and inverse directions using. a linear regression model, an Artificial Neural Network, and a data-driven Nearest-Neighbor lookup table. We find that forward models perform more accurately than inverse models and that the Nearest-Neighbor approach has a notable fit error at the edges of the input space. These results open a new front for a thorough understanding of how the actual physics of an anatomical system (i.e., the plant the brain must contend with) fundamentally affects learning, memory, and performance of motor function in health, disease, and in an evolutionary context. Figure 1: A parallel coordinate plot of 5000 muscle tension patterns implemented on a human cadaver finger highlights how sparsely the edges of the input space are explored with uniform sampling.">

      <tr title="Deciding how to move the hand along a given path to produce activities for daily living (ADLs) involves multiple factors such as limb kinetics, choice of muscle activation patterns, online error corrections, robustness to perturbations, accounting for length/velocity muscle mechanics and time-sensitive reflex modulation. In Hagen & Valero-Cuevas (2017) we show how the joint rotations associated with different paths induce different musculotendon (MT) velocities. While different paths will naturally produce different MT velocities, we found that similar paths can exhibit different MT velocity profiles. This matters at the level of individual muscles because differences in MT velocities will require unique muscle activation strategies to compensate for force-length/force-velocity properties and modulation of their spinal reflex mechanisms. Importantly, these differences in MT velocities within and across paths establish the neuromechanical landscape that determines the robustness of muscle coordination patterns and reflex modulation strategies during ADLs.Here we study how initial variability in the direction of a hand path affects the subsequent time histories of MT velocities. As in our prior work, we used an 18 muscle, 2 joint planar arm model to produce 100 random reaching paths for 6 different pairs of points on a tabletop (3 pairs shared the starting position, 3 pairs shared the ending location). Each valid, smooth reaching path was generated (and its MT velocities found) using a pseudo-random clamped cubic spline, parameterized to follow a bell-shaped tangential velocity curve, simulating reaching movements of 35 cm in length with initial errors compatible with those seen in reaching studies in humans.We find that uniform initial error (i.e., variability) across paths induces non-uniform distributions of MT velocities. That is, although the induced MT velocities follow a similar profile for each reaching movement, their distributions/deviations change across them. This implies that some reaching paths may be more or less forgiving to initial errors in muscle coordination or reflex modulation. This has important consequences to the study of healthy movement, as well as the rehabilitation of movement for ADLs in neurological conditions and stroke.">

      <tr title="Involuntary force variability is an inherent property of motor behavior. When exacerbated, it is a key contributor to performance errors and a feature of several neurological conditions. Some propose that involuntary force variability arises primarily through the conversion of motoneuron firing patterns into muscle force, i.e. “motor noise.” This mechanism has been tested using a model of recruitment and rate coding developed by Fuglevand et al. (1993). However, this model has several drawbacks that limit its ability to simulate force variability. First, it does not explicitly model the fusion of force twitches with increases in firing rate and concomitant saturation of calcium binding to troponin. Second, the model lacks a series elastic element (i.e., tendon), which damps out the effects of fluctuations of motoneurone firing by changing its length and, thereby, the velocity of the muscle fibers in an externally isometric system. We addressed these limitations by combining some elements of the Fuglevand model with physiological and mechanical features from a model by Song et al. (2008). This new model has improved predictions of force and force variability. Upon close inspection, we show the amplitude and spectral features of force variability are significantly influenced by the viscoelastic properties of musculotendons. This model of motor units produces a lower amplitude of force variability than previous models. Also, spectral features of this new model resemble more closely what has been observed experimentally. These results question current thinking attributing the majority of involuntary force variability to peripheral motor noise, and highlight the importance of closed-loop behavior including afferent feedback and error corrections.">

      <tr title="In Niu, et al. (2017) we implemented a realtime Field-Programmable Gate Array  (FPGA)-based simulation of neuromorphic models of monosynaptic stretch reflex circuitry of an agonist-antagonist muscle-pair. We then characterized the system in Jalaleddini, et al. (2017) by coupling the simulation to the flexor digitorum profundus and the extensor carpi radialis longus tendons of the MCP joint of a cadaveric hand preparation to show that such systems can indeed evoke human-like stretch reflexes as in the work of Edin and Vallbo (1990). We now present improvements to that system such as including Golgi tendon organs, Renshaw cells, and polysynaptic interneuronal pathways to form a system akin to a simplified spinal-like regulator as in Raphael et al. (2010). Nonlinear adaptive controls and simple neural networks allow us tune the descending commands (pulse trains) to both fusimotor and alpha motoneuron pools. We use such time-based running of descending commands to demonstrate the ability to produce “voluntary” movement. We find that realistic models of muscle mechanics, force-velocity properties in particular, are critical to produce stable movements. By selectively adding/removing components and interconnections, we are also able to show the sufficiency of the same for enabling voluntary movement. Future extensions will include homonymous and heteronymous sensorimotor pathways to control more muscles and produce motor function in cadaveric human fingers.">

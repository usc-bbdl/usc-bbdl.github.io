            Frontiers in Neurorobotics, October 11, 2021.</td>
          <td><a href="https://github.com/usc-bbdl/usc-bbdl.github.io/papers/Hagen_insideOut_2021_Neurorobotics.pdf" title="Estimates of limb posture are critical for controlling robotic systems. This is generally accomplished with angle sensors at individual joints that simplify control but can complicate mechanical design and robustness. Limb posture should be derivable from each joint's actuator shaft angle but this is problematic for compliant tendon-driven systems where (i) motors are not placed at the joints and (ii) nonlinear tendon stiffness decouples the relationship between motor and joint angles. Here we propose a novel machine learning algorithm to accurately estimate joint posture during dynamic tasks by limited training of an artificial neural network (ANN) receiving motor angles and tendon tensions, analogous to biological muscle and tendon mechanoreceptors. Simulating an inverted pendulum—antagonistically-driven by motors and nonlinearly-elastic tendons—we compare how accurately ANNs estimate joint angles when trained with different sets of non-collocated sensory information generated via random motor-babbling. Cross-validating with new movements, we find that ANNs trained with motor angles and tendon tension data predict joint angles more accurately than ANNs trained without tendon tension. Furthermore, these results are robust to changes in network/mechanical hyper-parameters. We conclude that regardless of the tendon properties, actuator behavior, or movement demands, tendon tension information invariably improves joint angle estimates from non-collocated sensory signals.">Link</a></td>

              <b>"Reticulospinal drive with a flexor bias can be detected as a-band shared neural drive during voluntary tasks in healthy individuals" </b> <br>
              Proceedings of the 29th Annual Conference of the Society for Neural control of Movement, Toyama, JAPAN, April 24-27, 2019.</td>
          <td><a href="https://github.com/usc-bbdl/usc-bbdl.github.io/files/4113090/NCM_Abstract_AkiraNagamori.pdf" title="There is growing evidence suggesting that synchronized activity between muscles at ~10 Hz (alpha-band), quantified by coherence analysis, reflects their shared neural drive arising from the reticulospinal pathway. This a-band shared neural drive can be observed, for example, across muscles in response to acoustic startle, which is transmitted via the reticulospinal pathway. Interestingly, muscles involved in pathologic flexion synergy post stroke also show exaggerated alpha-band shared neural drive. This is consistent with a previous suggestion that inappropriate activation through the reticulospinal pathway is an important for expression of such pathologic synergies. However, little is known whether or not such drive exists in healthy individuals during voluntary actions. To test this possibility, we measured intermuscular coherence between the muscle pairs driving isometric wrist torque in 4 directions (flexion and extension, and radial and ulnar deviation). As present in flexion synergies post stroke, we expect that flexor muscles receive stronger reticulospinal drive, and therefore stronger a-band shared neural drive, compared to extensors. Conversely, corticospinal drive may play the predominant role in the control of radial/ulnar deviation. Thus, we expect a lack of a-band shared neural drive between muscles during those actions. We first asked twelve consenting participants to produce constant, isometric wrist flexion or extension torque at 20% MVC, and calculated pair-wise EMG coherence across synergistic wrist flexors and extensors. We found that wrist flexors showed significantly higher alpha-band coherence compared to the extensors (p < 0.01). This was not altered by error augmentation in visual feedback, nor related to force variability during the isometric holds (both of which can alter proprioceptive feedback). Since the relative strength of reticulospinal drive may increase with contraction level, we then asked three of the participants to perform the wrist flexion task at 5% and 30% MVC. In them, coherence in the alpha-band increased with contraction level (p < 0.01). Finally, to confirm the dominance of corticospinal drive in radial-ulnar deviation torques, we asked a subset of participants (n = 2) to perform those actions. We found no significant alpha-band coherence between radial deviators (FCR and ECR) nor ulnar deviators (FCU and ECU). Our results strongly suggest that intermuscular coherence reflects the differential contribution of corticospinal vs. reticulospinal pathways during voluntary actions by healthy individuals. The impactful corollary to this result is that intermuscular coherence can be used to assess reorganization of cortico- and reticulo-spinal pathways that results in pathologic synergies.">Link</a></td>
